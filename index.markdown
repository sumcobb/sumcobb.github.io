Hey, I am Summer Cobb, a software developer. Working at Oracle.<br>

This website is a work in progress. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects). I write [blog posts](/posts) about coding and things. 

Outside of programming, I enjoy photography, running, and crocheting. Some of my photos can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/summerc0bb).
